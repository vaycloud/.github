**Minimal Infra. Maximum Speed.**

VAY builds ultra-low latency infrastructure for the real world — from the kernel up.

We design systems for:

- 🎮 Real-time multiplayer gaming
- 🛰️ Latency-critical communication
- 🌍 Distributed edge networks

**What we do:**

- 🧠 Intelligent routing with sub-40ms latency across borders
- 🧰 Custom Linux kernel tuning and networking stacks
- ⚡ Performance-focused tunnels using eBPF/XDP

> Everything we build runs close to the metal.  
> `zero up` and you're live.

#### 🌀 VAY Philosophy

- Minimalism is power  
- Latency is everything  
- Control every nanosecond  

We don’t chase throughput. We chase precision.
